# Inspiron 15-7568 OpenCore Folder

Please be sure to use proper tools when editing these files. 
Personally I used OC Auxilliary Tools, but your mileage can (and likely will) vary. 

This was set up with OpenCore version 0.8.4 in mind, if I remember right.

Use your own serial, don't be weird. Bluetooth is bugged on Monterey and later from my knowledge, and sleep makes this laptop unhappy. 
Still not sure how to fix that just yet, but I'll get there.
